### The Problem
According to Central Bureau of Statistics (Badan Pusat Statistik), there are 4.7 million citizens live in contract houses or boarding houses. Rental rooms or boarding houses have long been one of Indonesia's most popular housing options. It gives a less expensive but no less viable solution for people who live distant from their place of employment or study. With so many housing options available throughout Indonesia, it may be challenging for both landlords and tenants to strike the appropriate balance that provides the greatest solution for both parties. Rental searchers may feel frustrated in their search for perfect rooms or houses, while property owners may find it difficult to sell their properties through reliable third parties. Finding a home is simple, but finding the perfect home is more difficult. EasyRent has made it our mission to make it simple for both landlords and renters to have a trustworthy third party who can give the best experience possible.

### The Solution
EasyRent is a website where users can find boarding houses or rental rooms to rent in only a few clicks, and landlords may post their properties for rent. EasyRent is a trustworthy third party that ensures the safety of both tenants and landlords. You can log in to EasyRent as either a tenant or a landlord. Browse listings, read reviews and ratings, and search and filter listings as tenants. After authentication through KTP (Kartu Tanda Penduduk) through the Nodeflux API, landlords can quickly post, update, view, and delete their listings.
